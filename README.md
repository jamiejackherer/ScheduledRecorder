# ScheduledRecorder
Android sound recorder app with scheduled recordings

Details for nerds: the app implements the MVVM pattern with clean architecture using Android Data Binding Library and architecture components (Room, ViewModel, LiveData). In the RecordFragment a ViewModel is used to connect to a local Service providing recording's info.
